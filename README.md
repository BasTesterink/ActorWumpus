# ActorWumpus
Demo multi-agent system for the actor based 2APL platform.

Clone the directory and import it in Eclipse. Then run the main of main.ActorWumpusMain to start the system. Standard debugging is on. This will create output files (in the ./output/ folder) that contain traces of agent states in the JSON format. A demo is also available which you can run with the 'java -jar demo' command. You do need the resource directory cloned locally and an output folder. 

The system works with up to 4 agents.
