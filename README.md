# ActorWumpus
Demo multi-agent system for the actor based 2APL platform.

Clone the directory and import it in Eclipse. Then run the main of main.ActorWumpusMain to start the system. Standard debugging is on. This will create output files (in the ./output/ folder) that contain traces of agent states in the JSON format. 

The System works with up to 4 agents.
